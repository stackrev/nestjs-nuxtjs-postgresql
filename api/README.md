## WorkFlow

The git workflow we're using at Tamuk project is Gitflow, a very popular workflow by Vincent Driessen.

Each step is briefly explained here so that you can start a feature and develop branch, and perform bug fixes on both release branches and the master branch.

Git extensions provide high-level repository operations for [Vincent Driessen's branching model][git-branching-model].

For more info, refer to the links: [git-flow-wiki] , [git-flow-cheatsheet] and [why-arent-you-using-git-flow].

### Start a new feature branch

Suppose, you want to do the task **locations**. The feature branch will be **F-locations**. So, From the scrum board:

- Move the task _F-locations_ from **'To Do'** to **'In Progress'** column
- Assgin it to yourself
- Open terminal
- Perform the following command:

```sh
$ git flow feature start locations
```

### Mark a feature as completed

When a feature was completed, perform the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ git add [your-changes-on-the-feature-branch]
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
$ git flow feature finish -r -F -S
```

Now, you are in the develop branch.

- Get the latest changes

```sh
$ git pull origin develop
```

You may encounter a conflict; In this case fix the conflicts and then commit the result. After that,

- Assert that your feature is still functional in the develop branch.
- Push the changes to remote:

```sh
$ git push
```

> **Note**: Make sure you're pushing to origin/develop.
